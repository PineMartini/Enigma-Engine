# Enigma Engine
A text adventure game engine created as a simple, modern, cross-platform, lightweight alternative to Quest (http://textadventures.co.uk/quest)

## How to Run the Program
Download and extract the ZIP file of the source code. Open the file "Editor/Enigma Engine.html" in your favorite browser. This will bring up the game editor.

## Manual
See the attached "Manual.pdf" file for instructions on how to use this engine. A video tutorial is also planned, so stay tuned!

## Features
* MAP: Automatic map generation.
* MULTIMEDIA SUPPORT: Supports audio and images.
* GAME-SAVING: In-built game-saving mechanism.
* CROSS-PLATFORM: Both the Editor and the generated games run in the browser, so they're fully cross-platform. The generated games also have an adaptable UI that is usable on both mobiles and PCs.
* NON-PROGRAMMER-FRIENDLY: This engine writes code for you, so no programming knowledge is required. If you've ever used software like GDevelop, Construct 2 etc. you should feel right at home - it's just a tiny step-up.
* LIGHTWEIGHT: As the Runtime Engine has been written from scratch and does not depend on any third-party libraries, the games produced by this engine are incredibly lightweight - an empty game is a just over 60KB!
* POWERFUL: You can extend the built-in functionality with your own JavaScript, so there's no limits to what you can do!

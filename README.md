# Enigma Engine v3.0
A text adventure game engine created as a simple, cross-platform, lightweight alternative to Quest (http://textadventures.co.uk/quest).

## How to Run the Program
You can use the online version of the editor here: https://media.textadventures.co.uk/games/DjEemAqBMkGy9ZvOwmXDGQ/index.html

Your game data is not stored in the cloud and never leaves your PC - once loaded, the editor runs fully offline on your PC.

Alternatively, download and extract the .zip file of this repository and open the file "Editor/Enigma Engine.html" in your favourite browser.

## Manual
See the attached "Manual.pdf" file for instructions on how to use this engine. A video tutorial is also planned, so stay tuned!

## Features
* MAP: Automatic map generation.
* MULTIMEDIA SUPPORT: Supports audio and images.
* GAME-SAVING: In-built game-saving mechanism.
* CROSS-PLATFORM: Both the Editor and the generated games run in the browser, so they're fully cross-platform. The generated games also have an adaptable UI that is usable on both mobiles and PCs.
* LIGHTWEIGHT: As the Runtime Engine has been written from scratch and does not depend on any third-party libraries, the games produced by this engine are incredibly lightweight - an empty game is just over 60KB!
* POWERFUL: You can extend the built-in functionality with your own JavaScript, so there's no limits to what you can do!
